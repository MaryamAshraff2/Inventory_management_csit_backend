# Location-Based Discard Implementation (No Procurement Dependency)

## Overview
This update completely rewrites the discard functionality to remove procurement dependency and implement proper location-based inventory tracking. The system now tracks discards using location ID and item ID, reducing available quantity at the specific location where the discard happens.

## Problem Statement
The previous discard implementation had several critical issues:
1. **Procurement Dependency**: Required selecting procurement before location, which was unnecessary
2. **Incorrect Inventory Tracking**: Did not properly track location-specific inventory
3. **Complex Workflow**: Users had to navigate through procurement → location → item selection
4. **Data Integrity Issues**: Discards could affect wrong locations

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated DiscardedItemSerializer (serializers.py)
- **File**: `backend/inventory/serializers.py`
- **Changes**: Completely rewrote the `create` method to:
  - Remove procurement dependency
  - Use location-based inventory tracking
  - Only affect TotalInventory records at the specified location
  - Properly update item totals (total_quantity, dead_stock_quantity, available_quantity)
  - Use FIFO order when removing from multiple inventory records

#### 2. New API Endpoint - Items at Location (items.py)
- **File**: `backend/inventory/views/items.py`
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /inventory/items/items_at_location/?location_id={id}`
- **Purpose**: Get all items available at a specific location
- **Features**:
  - Handles Main Store (uses Item.available_quantity)
  - Handles other locations (uses TotalInventory)
  - Returns item details with available quantities
  - Includes category, order number, supplier, and unit price information

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Completely Rewritten Discard Form (AddDiscardedItemForm.jsx)
- **File**: `frontend2/src/components/AddDiscardedItemForm.jsx`
- **Major Changes**:
  - **Removed procurement field** completely
  - **Simplified workflow**: Location → Item → Quantity
  - **Real-time API calls** to fetch items at selected location
  - **Better validation** with available quantity checks
  - **Improved UX** with loading states and clear feedback
  - **Location-based item filtering** using new API endpoint

#### 2. Updated DiscardedItems Page (DiscardedItems.jsx)
- **File**: `frontend2/src/pages/DiscardedItems.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed procurement dependency
  - Removed totalInventory state (now fetched via API)
  - Simplified data fetching
  - Updated form props to match new structure

#### 3. Enhanced API Service (api.js)
- **File**: `frontend2/src/services/api.js`
- **New Method**: `itemsAPI.getItemsAtLocation(locationId)`
- **Purpose**: Fetch items available at a specific location

## Key Features

### 1. Location-First Approach
- Users select location first, then see available items
- No procurement selection required
- Direct location-based inventory access

### 2. Real-Time Inventory Validation
- Shows available quantity for each item at the location
- Prevents discarding more than available
- Clear error messages for insufficient quantities

### 3. Proper Inventory Tracking
- Reduces available quantity at the specific location only
- Updates item totals correctly
- Maintains data integrity across locations

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Loading states for better feedback
- Clear item selection with available quantities
- Simplified workflow (3 steps instead of 4)

### 5. API-Driven Architecture
- New dedicated endpoint for location-based item retrieval
- Efficient data fetching
- Better separation of concerns

## Database Schema
The implementation uses the existing schema efficiently:
```python
class DiscardedItem(models.Model):
    item = models.ForeignKey(Item, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    location = models.ForeignKey(Location, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Key field
    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
    reason = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=REASON_CHOICES)
    discarded_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint: Items at Location
```
GET /inventory/items/items_at_location/?location_id={id}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "location_id": 1,
  "location_name": "Main Store",
  "items": [
    {
      "item_id": 1,
      "item_name": "Laptop",
      "available_qty": 10,
      "location_id": 1,
      "location": "Main Store",
      "category": "Electronics"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow Changes

### Before (Procurement-Based)
1. Select Procurement
2. Select Location (filtered by procurement)
3. Select Item (filtered by procurement + location)
4. Enter Quantity
5. Select Reason
6. Select User
7. Submit

### After (Location-Based)
1. Select Location
2. Select Item (filtered by location)
3. Enter Quantity
4. Select Reason
5. Select User
6. Submit

## Benefits

### 1. **Simplified User Experience**
- Fewer steps in the discard process
- More intuitive workflow
- Clear location-based item selection

### 2. **Better Data Integrity**
- Location-specific inventory tracking
- Prevents cross-location inventory errors
- Accurate available quantity validation

### 3. **Improved Performance**
- Direct API calls for location-specific data
- Reduced client-side filtering
- Better caching opportunities

### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**
- Cleaner code structure
- Better separation of concerns
- More testable components

### 5. **Future-Proof Architecture**
- Easy to extend for new location types
- Scalable API design
- Flexible inventory tracking

## Testing
A comprehensive test script has been created:
- **File**: `test_location_based_discard.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests the new location-based discard functionality
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, discard creation, inventory updates
- **Verification**: Ensures location-specific inventory tracking

## Migration Notes
- **No database migrations required** - uses existing schema
- **Backward compatible** - existing discard records remain valid
- **Gradual rollout** - can be deployed without affecting existing data
- **No data loss** - all existing functionality preserved

## Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Deploy backend changes
- [ ] Deploy frontend changes
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Verify discard functionality
- [ ] Test inventory tracking
- [ ] Validate user workflow
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

## Future Enhancements
1. **Bulk Discard Operations**: Allow discarding multiple items at once
2. **Discard Templates**: Predefined discard reasons and workflows
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter items by category, supplier, etc.
4. **Discard History**: Enhanced reporting and analytics
5. **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile devices

This implementation provides a solid foundation for location-based inventory management while maintaining simplicity and user-friendliness.
