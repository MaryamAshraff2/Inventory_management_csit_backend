# Excel Export Functionality

## What Happens When You Click "Export Excel"

When you click the Excel export button in the Reports page, the following sequence of events occurs:

### 1. Frontend Process

#### Button Click Event
- The `exportReport('excel')` function is called
- The system checks if there's report data available (`reportData?.report_id`)
- If no report data exists, an error message is shown: "No report data available for export"
- If report data exists, the export process begins

#### API Call
- The frontend calls `reportsAPI.exportExcel(reportData.report_id)`
- This makes a POST request to: `http://localhost:8000/inventory/reports/{report_id}/export_excel/`
- The request includes the report ID in the URL

#### File Download Process
- The backend returns an Excel file (not JSON)
- The frontend receives the file as a blob
- A temporary download link is created
- The file is automatically downloaded to your browser's default download folder
- The temporary link is cleaned up

### 2. Backend Process

#### Report Data Retrieval
The backend performs the following steps:

1. **Get Report Object**: Retrieves the report from the database using the provided ID
2. **Extract Filters**: Gets the original filters used to generate the report
3. **Re-run Queries**: Applies the same filters to get the current data
4. **Build Report Data**: Creates a structured data object with all report information

#### Excel Generation
The backend uses the `openpyxl` library to generate a professional Excel file:

1. **Create Excel Workbook**: Initializes a new Excel workbook with a worksheet
2. **Add Title**: Creates a centered title (e.g., "Procurement Report")
3. **Add Metadata**: Includes generation date, total records, and summary statistics
4. **Create Data Table**: Generates a formatted table with all report data
5. **Apply Styling**: Adds professional styling with:
   - Blue header background (#366092)
   - White bold text for headers
   - Light gray data rows (#F2F2F2)
   - Black borders around all cells
   - Centered alignment
   - Auto-adjusted column widths

#### File Response
- Creates a unique filename: `{report_type}_report_{report_id}_{timestamp}.xlsx`
- Sets proper HTTP headers for file download
- Returns the Excel file as an HTTP response

### 3. Excel Content Structure

#### Header Section
- **Title**: Report type (e.g., "Procurement Report") - merged across columns A-H
- **Generation Date**: When the report was created
- **Total Records**: Number of items in the report
